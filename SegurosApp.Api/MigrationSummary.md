# Migration and Modernization of SegurosApp Backend

## Summary
- Migrated backend from .NET Framework 4.7.2 to .NET 8
- Created new ASP.NET Core Web API project: `SegurosApp.Api`
- Copied and refactored all model classes for EF Core 9
- Installed EF Core 9 packages
- Created `SegurosDbContext` and registered it in DI
- Added connection string to `appsettings.json`
- Added design-time factory for EF Core tooling
- Updated EF Core CLI tools to version 9
- Troubleshooted EF Core migration issues (configuration loading, file copying)

## Key Steps
1. **Created new Web API project**
2. **Copied and refactored models** to `SegurosApp.Api/Models`
3. **Installed EF Core 9 packages**
4. **Created `SegurosDbContext`**
5. **Configured DI and connection string**
6. **Added design-time factory**
7. **Updated EF Core CLI tools**
8. **Ensured `appsettings.json` is copied to output**
9. **Improved design-time factory to search for config**
10. **Attempted migrations and provided troubleshooting**

## Next Steps
1. **Define API Contracts:**
   - Create DTOs and controllers in SegurosApp.Api for each business entity and operation you want to expose.
2. **Move Business Logic:**
   - Refactor your BLL and repository code from SegurosApp into SegurosApp.Api, adapting for dependency injection and stateless API patterns.
3. **Update SegurosApp Frontend:**
   - Change your controllers and views in SegurosApp to call the new API endpoints (using HttpClient or AJAX).
4. **Test End-to-End:**
   - Ensure the SegurosApp frontend works correctly with the new API backend.
5. **(Optional) Add Authentication:**
   - If needed, implement authentication/authorization in the API and update the frontend to handle tokens/cookies.

## Outstanding Issues
- EF Core migration still fails to load `appsettings.json` (likely due to working directory or file path issues)
- Next step: Run migration from the correct directory or further improve config path resolution
